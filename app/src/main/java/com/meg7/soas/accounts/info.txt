Logic Implementation

1: Sign In/Sign Up  Activity (AuthActivity) must extend AccountAuthenticatorActivity, as this activity is launched
whenever Add Account action is called from anywhere
2: AuthActivity is called from AccountAuthenticator class , where there are different methods for different
account action. These methods are to be defined by ourselves as per our need
3: AccountAuthenticator class is called from AccountAuthenticatorService, whenever Add Account action or
action related to Accounts is called
   So Add Account Action Called --> AccountAuthenticatorService listens --> AccountAuthenticator class
   is called --> AuthActivity is called

4: For all these classes to function properly, it should  be defined on manifest file along with xml/
  account_authenticator.xml

5: SoasAccountManager is a simple class which lists all the accounts,delete all the accounts
   and add User to the account
